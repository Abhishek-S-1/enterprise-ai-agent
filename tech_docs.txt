    DATABRICKS PLATFORM DOCUMENTATION (2025)
    
    1. UNITY CATALOG (Governance):
       - Unity Catalog provides centralized access control, auditing, lineage, and data discovery across Databricks workspaces.
       - Key Feature: 'Lakehouse Federation' allows querying external databases (PostgreSQL, Snowflake) without moving data.
       - Best Practice: Use 'Managed Identities' for secure access to storage buckets (S3/ADLS).
       
    2. DELTA LIVE TABLES (ETL):
       - DLT is a declarative framework for building reliable data pipelines.
       - It automatically handles infrastructure scaling and data quality checks (expectations).
       - 'Enforcement' rule: DROP ROW creates a quarantine for bad data rather than failing the pipeline.
       
    3. MODEL SERVING (Mosaic AI):
       - Databricks Model Serving allows you to deploy LLMs and Scikit-learn models as REST APIs.
       - Supports 'Provisioned Throughput' for guaranteed latency on Llama 3 models.
       - Zero-copy model deployment using MLflow Registry.
       
    4. COST OPTIMIZATION:
       - Use 'Jobs Compute' for automated workflows (cheaper than All-Purpose).
       - Enable 'Serverless SQL' to avoid paying for idle cluster time.
